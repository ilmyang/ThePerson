## ✨ Contributions You Can Make

There are many ways you can contribute: Adding a feature, fixing code, 
finding and reporting bugs, improving documentation, and more!

Any addition to the project will be very much appreciated, even small ones.

## 👣 Pull Request Steps

(NOTE: Read "[Suggesting a Feature](#-suggesting-a-feature)" first if you 
plan on adding an enhancement to the project)

1. Create a fork of [the repository][repo]
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine
3. Create a new branch with a meaningful name (include the type of change 
   followed by a slash; use hierarchical branch naming)

   | Prefix       | Description                                    |
   |--------------|------------------------------------------------|
   | `bugfix`     | Bug fix (minor, not urgent)                    |
   | `hotfix`     | Urgent, critical fix                           |
   | `feature`    | New feature/functionality                      |
   | `ui`         | Affects user interface only                    |
   | `docs`       | Documentation only                             |
   | `format`     | Formatting fixes                               |
   | `refact`     | Code improvements that do not affect behaviour |
   | `wip`        | Work in progress                               |
   | `experiment` | Temporary, experimental code; playground       |
   | `mix`        | A combination of different fixes/changes       |
   | `misc`       | Other (not recommended)                        |

   - e.g.) `feature/feature-name`, `fix/issue-12`
   
4. Make and commit your changes
   - Commit messages should be in the imperative tone without a period
     - e.g.: `Add test files`, `Fix attribute assignments`, `Update 
     documentation`
5. Push commits to GitHub (if you have made changes locally on your machine)
6. Create and submit a pull request
7. Request a review from a maintainer

We will likely need to discuss the changes you make and apply some tweaks 
and polishes before approval.

You should receive a notification/email once your changes have been merged 
onto the main branch of this project.

### ⚠️ THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:
- Avoid working directly on `main`; always create a new branch on your fork.
- To avoid conflicts, always remember to update your local fork (`git pull`) 
  before working.
- If you forgot to update your fork before working, run `git pull --rebase` 
  and resolve conflicts (if any).
  - If you run into any trouble during conflict resolution, or are not sure 
    how to resolve a conflict, tag a maintainer/reviewer in an appropriate 
    issue or PR comment section, or in a [Discussion][repo-disc], for help.
- If you ever need to force-push, use `--force-with-lease` to prevent losing 
  any work.
- Minimize how much code you touch outside what you are working on; change 
  only what you are focusing on doing and avoid changing others' code.

## 📋 Task Issues

Some issues will be opened in the [Issues tab][repo-issues] on GitHub, labeled 
`task`. 

**If you are interested in completing a task**: 
1. Make sure you give the instructions in the task description a proper read
2. **Leave a comment requesting assignment under the issue**
3. Wait for a thumbs-up from a maintainer
4. Follow the steps above to create a fork and PR with your changes
5. Start coding!

**When writing the pull request**:
- Start the title the PR with `TASK: `.
- In your PR description, **ensure you use an issue-closing keyword phrase:**

```markdown
# TASK: Title of task (#123)

This is a description of the task completed. 
Blah blah blah.

Closes #123
```

Where `#123` is the issue number.

Other issue-closing keywords you can use:
* close
* closes
* closed
* fix
* fixes
* fixed
* resolve
* resolves
* resolved

### Note:

Each task issue is labeled with its approximate difficulty level.

To ensure fair distribution of tasks amongst contributors, **please 
try to complete tasks labeled with your level of coding experience only** 
(everyone should have a chance to contribute)

## 🧰 Making Your First Contribution

If you're new here or are not familiar with contributing to repositories on 
GitHub, [here's a repo][first-contribs] with information that might help.

## 🧭 Code Guidelines

Here are **3 rules** we have with writing (Python) code:

> `1.` Try to follow PEP 8 as much as possible

Key things to keep in mind include:
- **Line lengths** (try to keep line **below 80 characters**; PEP 8 says 79 but 
  whichever works)
- **Naming conventions** (module, variable, class, and function names)
  - `variable_must_be_named_like_this`
  - `functions_too`
  - `also_modules`
  - `ClassesMustBeNamedLikeThis`
- **Docstring and comments formatting**
- **Line separations** (2 blank lines around classes and functions, etc.)
- **Order of import statements** (standard → third-party → local)

Take a look at existing code on the repo to get an idea of the code style.

If you are unfamiliar with PEP 8, please [give it a quick read][pep-8].

===============================================

> `2.` Always assume the user is stupid

Special cases (almost) always exist. Make sure you take into account as many 
input possibilities as you can, even those that anyone in the right mind would 
never think of.

===============================================

> `3.` Don't be boring

Give your code some _personality_. Avoid dull, flavorless code. You can even 
add a little joke comment if your code starts to look sleep-inducing.

## ☝️ Suggesting a Feature

(We recommend opening a feature request before working on an issue, even if 
you are confident in your feature.)

If:
- You do not wish to code any features yourself
- You are not sure/confident about your proposal and are looking for 
  approval/suggestions...

...feel free to either open an issue:
1. On the repository on GitHub, go to the [Issues][repo-issues] tab.
2. Select "New issue"
3. Template selection: Choose "Feature request"
4. Describe the feature thoroughly, using the template as a guide
5. Submit the issue.

...or add a comment under a [discussion][repo-disc] describing the feature.
